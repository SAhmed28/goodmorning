# Enhancing Functionalities
1. Created random values to pass to the process() method of parent class Request, Since URI's can be random. 
2. Calculated All response time in milliseconds.
3. Stored the response times and calculated mean, std and normalized histogram.
4. Additionally wrote codes to understand the returning array dimention from the methods of my child class (MyClass()) as well as to view it on the browser (commented it out at the end of the code).

# Unit Testing
For Unit Testing, Extend the Request class with PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
Then run in the terminal-  ./vendor/bin/phpunit
